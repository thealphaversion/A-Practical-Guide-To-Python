# A-Practical-Guide-To-Python

This repository is where we learn together. The aim is to learn all we can about python, first generally and then moving into specifics and then in the end, develop a mini project (that I have not decided on yet, oops) using all the knowledge that we gain from this adventure. 

Any contribution to this journey is appreciated.

## To get started with learning,
1. Install Python3. You can find out how to do that [here](https://www.javatpoint.com/how-to-install-python).
2. Clone this repository.
3. That's it. Go through the files. Run them using `python *filename*.py` or `python3 *filename*.py`
