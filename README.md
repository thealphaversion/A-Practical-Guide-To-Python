# A-Practical-Guide-To-Python

This repository is where we learn together. The aim is to learn all we can about python, first generally and then moving into specifics and then in the end, develop a mini project (that I have not decided on yet, oops) using all the knowledge that we gain from this adventure. 

Any contribution to this journey is appreciated. If you find any mistakes, create an issue or a pull request regarding the same.

### basic
This directory contains all files related to the basic python syntax and basic data structures.

### algorithms
This directory contains implementations of different problem statements and alogrithms.

## To get started with learning
1. Install Python3. You can find out how to do that [here](https://www.javatpoint.com/how-to-install-python).
2. Clone this repository.
3. That's it. Go through the files. Run them using `python filename.py` or `python3 filename.py`

If you are stating with python, then I would recommend that you start with the **basics** directory and then move on to the **algorithms** directory.
